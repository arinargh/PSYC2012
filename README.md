# PSYC2012
I tutor the University of Sydney course PSYC2012: Statistics and Research Methods, introducing undergraduate Psychology and Neuroscience students to the foundations of empirical research design, as well as the common methods of quantitative and qualitative data analysis.

## Student mailing list
**Code:** [`mailing_list.py`](https://github.com/arinargh/PSYC2012/blob/main/mailing_list.py)

**Description**: I supplement my students' learning by sending them weekly emails to briefly recap the topics covered, a student copy of the Powerpoint slides I prepare and present in class and a detailed breakdown of the solutions to the prior week's quiz. These materials are sent out every Monday morning.

All students will receive the weekly email, but the student slides and quiz solutions will only be sent out to students who attend the corresponding tutorial (e.g., Students who attend tutorial 2 but not tutorial 3 will receive the solutions to quiz 2. They'll also receive a student copy of the slides for tutorial 2 but not 3).

This program was created to automatically generate weekly mailing lists to save time and reduce the number of emails I'd have to send out to my students.
